# PKGBUILDs
Contains PKGBUILD files for creating Arch Linux packages:

* Packages [I maintain in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=M&K=lambroisie&outdated=&SB=v&SO=d&PP=50&do_Search=Go):
* Other packages imported from the AUR to build with slight modifications

So if you like to improve one of my AUR packages, just create a PR here.
